# Lab 1

Before beginning, make sure your environment is properly set up.
This is documented in the [README for this repository](../README.md).

The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain experience with basic methods for training, evaluating, and critiquing machine learning models
using some of the most common Python machine learning libraries:
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

For this lab, you will be working in groups of 2-3 people.   You should *each* submit a copy of your code (which can/should be identical) and you should jointly submit one version of the written component of the lab via Canvas.

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit your assignment by running `python3 -m autograder.cli.submission.submit assignment.ipynb` from your local repository directory.
This script will check for your email, password, and assignment id in `config.json`
and submit your work to a server controlled by the TAs where tests will be run, reporting the results back to you.
